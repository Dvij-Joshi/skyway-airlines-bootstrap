# SkyWay Airlines Static Website

This is a static version of the SkyWay Airlines project, converted from PHP to HTML for deployment on GitHub Pages.

## How to Host on GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and create a new repository (e.g., `skyway-airlines`).

2. **Upload Your Files**
   - Upload all the files and folders from this project (including `index.html`, all `.html` files, CSS, JS, images, etc.) to your new repository.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Under "Source", select the `main` branch and `/root` (or `/docs` if you put files there).
   - Click **Save**.
   - GitHub will provide a link to your live site (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/skyway-airlines/`).

4. **Access Your Site**
   - Visit the provided URL to see your static airline booking site live!

## Notes
- All backend functionality has been removed. This is a static demo for presentation purposes only.
- All links and forms are static and do not perform real actions.
